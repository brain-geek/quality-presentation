## Taking Shower

There are two ways of taking Shower: you can get full template or just an engine.

To get full [template](https://github.com/shower/template) based on [shower](https://github.com/shower/shower) engine and [ribbon](https://github.com/shower/ribbon) theme run following command:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:shower/template.git
```

To get only [shower](https://github.com/shower/shower) engine including [ribbon](https://github.com/shower/ribbon) theme, run this:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:shower/shower.git
```

Or you can just download latest version as ZIP file: [template](http://shwr.me/template.zip) or [shower](http://shwr.me/shower.zip).

## Printing to PDF

You can print your presentation to PDF using Google Chrome “Print to PDF” option in print dialog, [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf) or [Prince XML](http://princexml.com). Print styles should be supplied to a theme for proper results. Please see [print styles](https://github.com/shower/ribbon/blob/master/styles/print.scss) for the Ribbon theme as example.

Example of Shower template printed by Google Chrome: [PDF, 2.3 MB](https://github.com/shower/template/blob/master/index.pdf?raw=true).
